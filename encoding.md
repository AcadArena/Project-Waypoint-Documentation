# Data Encoding

Data is encoded by means of editable cells that are specific only for an indicator. Each indicator have their custom fields and its behavior is determined by its type (area, period, source, date, value...etc).

Some Indicators have multiple value components. These multiple values are encoded inside a dynamic sidebar whenever the user clicks on the value button.

The encoder module is composed of three Indicator categories, specifically, the RPFP (Responsible Parenthood - Family Planning), AHD (Adolescent Health and Development) and POPDEV (Population Development)

## Indicator Categories

Each indicator have its own unique form but has similar controls in data editing. These controls can be found at the top of an indicator table.
